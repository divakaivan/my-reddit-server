## A first of a kind API for me

Notes:
 - uses Postgres (first full app that uses psql as a db)
 - MikroORM -> switched to TypeORM
 - Redis for user tokens
 - TypeGraphql (my first graphql api with typescript)
 - TypeScript
 - reminded myself of SQL -> sometimes using TypeORM's QB, sometimes writing custom SQL
 

## To run

 - create a postgres db called my-reddit (or change the name in the index to what you need)
 - make sure to create a .env with the db's password
 - `npm run dev`
