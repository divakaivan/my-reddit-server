req.session.userId = user.id;

{userId: 1} -> send that to redis


1
create a hash that has the user object to it and store it in redis
sess:qwoeiuowqjoqjw -> { userId: 1 }

2
send the cookie to the user browser
express-session will set a cookie on my browser qwoieu9012798quw9euoe1i2uo

when user makes a request
qwoieu9012798quw9euoe1i2uo -> sent to the server

4
server decrypts the cookie
qwoieu9012798quw9euoe1i2uo -> sess:qwoeiuowqjoqjw

5
server makes a request to redis
will look up this hash -> get the data for it
sess:qwoeiuowqjoqjw -> { userId: 1 }

6. store the received data from redis to req.session
req.session = { userId: 1 }
